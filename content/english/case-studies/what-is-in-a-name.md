Why are we called Cinderblock?

A cinder block (also known as a breeze block) is a concrete block used for building walls and foundations.

As a software company targeting contractors, “Cinderblock” checked a few of the more obvious boxes:

* Construction related
* Memorable
* Easy to spell

But a 'cinder block' is more than just another brick in the wall. It frames our values, both as a product and a company: simplicity, stability, and reliability.

**Simplicity;** a cinder block is simple, its use is obvious, and it does exactly what it says on the tin.

**Stability;** they make buildings out of cinder blocks. Enough said.

**Reliability;** a cinder block is reliable, and so are we. We're straight shooters and won't make promises we can't deliver on.  
  
Building a solid and beautiful structure out of cinder blocks still needs a great team to put it all together. And true to form, behind our name we have that team. Here’s to our incredibly talented team, for designing, architecting, and building a software application that can be maintained and supported for years to come. Thank you guys!
