# Simplify Your Infrastructure Deployment with Terraspace

In the realm of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), streamlining the deployment process and managing complex cloud infrastructures can be a daunting task. Enter Terraspace, a powerful framework designed to simplify and enhance your Terraform workflows. In this blog post, we'll dive into what Terraspace is, its key features, and how it can revolutionize your infrastructure deployment.

## What is Terraspace?

Terraspace is an open-source framework that acts as a wrapper for Terraform, providing a more intuitive and efficient way to manage your infrastructure code. It enhances the development experience by adding functionalities such as modularity, environment management, and simplified deployments. Terraspace takes care of the boilerplate code, allowing you to focus on writing the actual infrastructure logic.

## Key Features of Terraspace

### 1. Modularity and Reusability

Terraspace encourages a modular approach to infrastructure code. It allows you to break down your code into smaller, manageable components, making it easier to maintain and reuse across projects. This modularity promotes best practices like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ensures consistency in your infrastructure.

### 2. Environment Management

Managing multiple environments (such as development, staging, and production) can be challenging. Terraspace simplifies this process by providing a clean separation between different environments. You can define environment-specific configurations and variables, allowing for seamless transitions between environments.

### 3. Built-in Testing Framework

Terraspace comes with an integrated testing framework that enables you to write automated tests for your infrastructure code. This ensures that your deployments meet the expected outcomes and reduces the risk of errors in production.

### 4. Plugin Ecosystem

Terraspace supports plugins, allowing you to extend its functionality and integrate with other tools seamlessly. This extensibility makes it easy to incorporate additional features or customize your workflow to suit your specific needs.

## Getting Started with Terraspace

### Install: Ubuntu/Debian

This page shows you how to install Terraspace on Ubuntu and Debian based Linux systems that use the apt package manager.

#### Ubuntu/Debian: apt-get install

##### Configure repo

```bash
sudo su
echo "deb https://apt.boltops.com stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/boltops.list
curl -s https://apt.boltops.com/boltops-key.public | apt-key add -
```

##### Install

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y terraspace
```
##### Remove

```bash
apt-get remove -y terraspace
```

## Creating a Test Project

To get started with Terraspace, let's create a new project. Use the following command to generate a basic structure for your project:

```bash
terraspace new demo
```

This command will create the necessary directories and files to kickstart your Terraspace project.

## Working with Terraspace

### 1. Module Development

Start by creating modules within your Terraspace project. Each module represents a specific piece of infrastructure (e.g., a VPC, EC2 instance, or RDS database). Define the module's configuration using Terraform HCL files.

### 2. Environment Configuration

Define environment-specific configurations in the `config/env` directory. This allows you to customize variables and settings for different environments.

### 3. Testing Your Infrastructure

Write automated tests for your infrastructure code using Terraspace's testing framework. This ensures that your deployments meet the desired criteria and functionality.

### 4. Deployment

Deploy your infrastructure using Terraspace with a simple command:

```bash
terraspace up demo
```

Terraspace will handle the deployment process, managing the Terraform execution and providing detailed output.

## Conclusion

Terraspace is a game-changer for managing and deploying cloud infrastructure with Terraform. Its modular approach, environment management capabilities, built-in testing framework, and plugin ecosystem make it a powerful tool in the IaC toolkit.

By adopting Terraspace, you can streamline your development process, improve code maintainability, and ensure a consistent and reliable infrastructure deployment pipeline.
