Legacy systems are a major cost driver for organizations, yet many businesses opt to retain these aging solutions. Taking a cue from [McKinsey's financial analogy](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-debt-reclaiming-tech-equity), let's explore how legacy systems contribute to technical debt.

Technical debt comprises two elements: principal, which encompasses the effort to modernize the technology stack, and interest, representing the complexity tax incurred by navigating fragile integrations and workarounds, collectively impeding productivity and impacting budgets and ROI. Businesses relying on legacy systems overlook an important caveat. The longer a company clings to legacy systems, the more it invests in keeping them alive, to the point where the cost of maintenance _surpasses_ that of an upgrade.

The decision to retain these systems often stem from the seamless continuity they _seem_ to provide in daily operations. There is also a perception that maintaining legacy system is cheaper than upgrading it to modern alternatives. But the data shows otherwise.

A survey by McKinsey revealed that CIOs allocate about 10-20 percent of their technology budget (dedicated for new products) to addressing technical debt. This allocation is driven by the pressing issues related to legacy systems:

1. Legacy systems, with their outdated code and architecture, consume a considerable share of resources for issue resolution, updates and upkeep. Some organizations see their annual maintenance costs increase by up to 15 percent, causing significant financial strain.
2. Beyond the apparent financial implications, hidden costs of legacy systems permeate various facets of business. These include challenges related to data security, customer experience, performance issues, and more.

The downsides of accumulation of technical debt are manifested through higher operational and technology expenses, slower time-to-market, and reduced adaptability. Effective technical debt management is essential for long-term viability, as mishandled technical debt can impede competitiveness. This significantly impacts a business's bottom line and its ability to adapt and innovate.

1. Maintaining legacy systems is resource-intensive and could become challenging as skilled professionals for these systems may become scarce. This could lead to integration challenges with new tools, and some legacy systems may require special licensing, adding complexity and costs for businesses.

2. Due to their outdated technology, legacy systems lack essential security features, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. The resulting security breaches or system compromises can lead to reputational damage and financial losses.
3. Adding to the escalating costs are frequent breakdowns and time need to restore legacy systems. These systems also drain resources from other business areas, causing inefficiencies, higher labor expenses, and financial limitations, which lead to delays and errors in introducing new products or services.
4. Legacy systems often don't meet modern compliance standards, making it difficult to stay in line with evolving regulatory requirements. This non-compliance can result in legal issues, fines, and disruptions to business operations.
